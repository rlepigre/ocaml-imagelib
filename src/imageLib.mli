   contained via the chunk_reader [ich].
   The exception [{!Corrupted_image} msg] is raised

   to convert to PNG if the file extension is unknown.

(* [openfile fn] reads the image in the file [fn]. This function guesses the
   image format using the extension, and raises [{!Corrupted_image} msg] in
   case of problem.
   NB: If the file extension is unknown, this will launch "convert" from
   imagemagick and attempt to convert to PNG before opening.

(* [writefile extension och img] writes the image [img] to the chunk reader [och]. 
   The desired format is specified via [extension].
   NB: If the file extension is unknown, this will launch "convert" from
   imagemagick and attempt to convert from after saving a PNG.
