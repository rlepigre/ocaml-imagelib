synopsis: "Library implementing parsing of image formats such as PNG, BMP, PPM"
description:
"""
The imagelib library implements image formats such as PNG, BMP, and PPM in
OCaml, relying on only one external dependency: 'decompress'.

Unix-dependent functionality such as reading or writing to files in the
filesystem are packaged separately in the 'imagelib-unix' OPAM package.

Supported image formats:
 - PNG (full implementation of RFC 2083),
 - PPM, PGM, PBM, ... (fully supported),
 - BMP (read-only)
 - JPG (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - GIF (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - XCF (only image size natively, conversion to PNG otherwise),
 - Utility functions for handling unimplemented formats are available in
   the 'imagelib-unix' OPAM package. See that package description for more info.

As imagelib only requires 'decompress', it can be used together with
js_of_ocaml to compile projects to Javascript, or from MirageOS unikernels.
