Chunk Ordering
==============

These test files will test the obligatory ordering relations between various
chunk types (not yet) as well as the number of data chunks used for the image.

- `oi1` - mother image with 1 idat-chunk
- `oi2` - image with 2 idat-chunks
- `oi4` - image with 4 unequal sized idat-chunks
- `oi9` - all idat-chunks of length one
