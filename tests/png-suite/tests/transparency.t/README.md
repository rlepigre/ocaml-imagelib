Transparency
============

Transparency should be used together with a background chunk. To test the
combination of the two the latter 4 tests are there. How to handle pictures
with transparency, but without a background, opinions can differ. Here we use
black, but especially in the case of paletted images, the normal color would
maybe even be better.

- `tbw` - transparent + white background
- `tbg` - transparent + gray background
- `tbb` - transparent + black background
- `tby` - transparent + yellow background
- `tp0` - not transparent for reference
- `tp1` - transparent, but no background chunk
- `tm3` - multiple levels of transparency, 3 entries
