Additional Palettes
===================

Besides the normal use of paletted images, palette chunks can in combination
with true-color (and other) images also be used to select color lookup-tables
when the video system is of limited capabilities. The suggested palette chunk
is specially created for this purpose.

- `pp` - normal palette chunk
- `ps` - suggested palette chunk
