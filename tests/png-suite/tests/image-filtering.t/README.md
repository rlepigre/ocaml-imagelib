Image Filtering
===============

PNG uses file-filtering, for optimal compression. Normally the type is of
filtering is adjusted to the contents of the picture, but here each file has
the same picture, with a different filtering.

- `f0` - no filtering
- `f1` - sub filtering
- `f2` - up filtering
- `f3` - average filtering
- `f4` - paeth filtering
